Riven World

The end of the Unified Age
War: Kaiju vs “The Old Gods” 
The Old Gods walked among us to fight the kaiju and “won” using some divine nuke macguffin but the resulting cataclysm shattered the world
Some godly sacrifice froze the now-drifting chunks of the planet in place, but was unable to fully reassemble the pieces into a cohesive planet
Resulting “planet” is chunks of habitable land floating through space held together into a cluster; something like an asteroid cluster
Possibly a gas giant or a magma core??

The Age of Rebuilding
A time of chaos and war as shattered kingdoms realigned and rebuilt around the new geography
Some cultures were divided between the Shards so some will have cultural overlaps, others will have entirely isolated homogenous societies; same with biomes
Magic is highly variable, whatever it was that made magic work is not evenly distributed; some Shards will be higher magic, some lower, some will be wild magic, etc.
Clerics are rare as most of the Old Gods either died or fled; alchemical tinctures are used for healing
As a parting shot, one of the “gods” gave their followers the power/tech/ritual to create Shardgates to bridge the islands; they are technically warlocks with the old god as their patron
End of the Age of Rebuilding the “gods” stepped back to their Olympus-equivalent. Divine Magic mostly dies out

The Age of Exploration - Current
There are some primary locations with portals that have established trade routes, but many of the Shards are still unexplored/isolated
Creating new portals requires unobtanium
Portal-making cult has leveraged building and maintaining the portals into political power across the shards -- equivalent to The Navigators Guild in Dune
Portals can be destroyed but not (easily?) replaced


TBD:
define/refine/un-IP-conflict the above
How does the other end of a portal get anchored if there is no way there without one and no way to know the locations of the unknown asteroids??
Astronomy???  Maybe the other side is anchored LOS, so telescopes are used?
Perhaps can be either LOS or anchored; I can’t see where I want to go from here, but if you bring this stone and set it there, it will be the seed for the other side
If something powers magic and said material is unevenly distributed, can it be mined/gathered/possessed?  Could a mage get their hands on pure magicstone to increase their power?
Is magicstone the same as unobtanium?
Themes:
Shards can be different settings so new players can explore a variety of styles
The feel will be very pulp adventure; they are members of The League of Modern Adventurers which sponsors expeditions to the unknown Shards
Quest types:  
Exploration is likely primary
caravan guards
explore found ruins
clear a new-found asteroid to make it safe to populate
